Forward Deployed Engineer,Chestnut,USA,"<div class=""h2""><strong>About Chestnut</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Chestnut is building the first AI-native operating system for insurance distribution by transforming how the $1T+ insurance industry allocates its largest spend: sales and distribution.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Backed by a16z, we’re replacing legacy systems with a modern, flexible platform that helps carriers automate complex workflows, optimize every distribution dollar, and unlock new growth. We have major insurers under contract, and early adopters are expanding.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">This is a generational platform shift. Recent advances in agentic AI make it possible to automate what was once manual and error-prone. We’ve spent years building the data model and context layer required to make this real, and now we’re scaling with urgency.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">At Chestnut, we operate with the belief that small, high-context teams working with best-in-class tools and colleagues can achieve outsized results. We embody what it means to be AI-lean: chasing 10x productivity gains that allow us to scale impact beyond our headcount.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">If you’re excited to modernize the infrastructure of one of America’s most essential industries, we’d love to meet you. Whether shaping core product experiences or laying the groundwork for intelligent automation, your work will accelerate a once-in-a-generation transformation.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2"">Engineering at Chestnut</div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We’re building the modern infrastructure for AI-driven insurance operations. That means well-structured data models, real-time event pipelines, clean APIs, and usable tools that support humans and agents working in parallel.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">As a Software Engineer at Chestnut, you’ll join a high-agency, cross-functional team focused on delivering impactful features fast. You’ll work across the stack, contribute to system design, and help shape the technical culture as we grow.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>Why This Role Exists</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We’re hiring a junior Forward Deployed Engineer to help us bring our product to life inside customer environments.

Fullstack Engineer,CompanyCam,USA,"<div class='""content-intro""'><div class=""h2"">Hi, we’re CompanyCam.</div>
<p>We’re a simple-to-use photo documentation and productivity app for contractors of all commercial and home services industries. Packed with intuitive functionality, CompanyCam facilitates unparalleled communication and accountability across a contractor’s entire business. We’re committed to providing a consumer-grade, game-changing experience that helps our users build trust within their company and with their customers.</p>
<p>But don’t let that corporate description fool you—the people behind our buttoned-up product are laid-back (but hardworking), genuine, and kickass, and you could be one of them! </p></div><div class=""h1"">The Role</div>
<p>We’re looking for a sharp, driven, problem-solving <strong>Fullstack Engineer</strong> to join our engineering team.</p>
<p>As a <strong>Fullstack Engineer</strong>, you’ll work alongside other engineers, designers, and product managers to tackle everything from huge company initiatives to modest but important bug fixes, <strong>from start to finish</strong>. You’ll also collaborate with your product team on discovery, helping to assess the direction and feasibility of product changes. We need people who help define what to do next—not merely take tickets.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong>you’ll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and processes of a growing engineering team</strong>. We want devs with opinions on patterns, code organization, and processes to help make sure our codebases scale healthily, and an interest in mentoring to help make sure our devs do too.</p>
<div class=""h2"">Working At CompanyCam</div>
<p>Our engineering team is remote-first, spanning every time zone in the United States. We welcome people from all backgrounds and really don't care whether or not you have a CS degree or even a high school diploma. All that matters is that you're not an a**hole and you're good at what you do.</p>
<p>At CompanyCam we’re driven to produce work with meaningful outcomes. That means not just dumping features and “improvements” but being able to reflect and learn from our outputs. We’re actively working to center our work on continuous discovery habits (CDH) as outlined by Teresa Torres.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s how we identify work to do, but how do we actually work? Our teams are made up of a product manager, a product designer, a tech lead and an appropriate number of engineers for the scope of your team. We take a flexible approach, pulling from Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and even Shape Up. Rather than being overly prescriptive, we provide guardrails and just enough constraints to keep teams moving. Each team is expected to collaborate, iterate, and refine their best practices to produce high-quality work.</p>
<div class=""h2"">What We Ask Of You</div>
<p><strong>Must-haves</strong></p>
<p>These are our non-negotiables:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style=""""><strong>Show up</strong>: give us your best and have the courage to do difficult but necessary stuff.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Grow up</strong>: be humble, take responsibility, learn continuously, and have a growth mindset.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Do good</strong>: treat your co-workers and customers the way you want to be treated.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>2+ years of experience working as a professional developer,</strong> with experience across both the backend and frontend (Not all years of experience are created equal, so this one isn't set in stone).</li>
<li style="""">Experience with <strong>React and/or React Native.</strong></li>
<li style="""">Experience with <strong>Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL</strong>.</li>
<li style="""">Familiarity with <strong>GraphQL</strong> and <strong>REST APIs</strong>.</li>
<li style="""">Experience working with <strong>Redis</strong>.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Reside permanently and currently somewhere in the U.S.</strong> Alas, we're not set up to hire outside of the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nice-to-haves</strong></p>
<p>Day to day, you’ll spend 90%+ of your time working in <strong>React and Ruby on Rails</strong>, but, of course, that’s not all you’ll work with. While experience with the following technologies are <em>not required</em> (we’re cool with some on-the-job learning), you will see them with varying levels of frequency:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">AWS (S3, EC2, etc.)</li>
<li style="""">ElasticSearch &amp; Redux</li>
<li style="""">AI tools such as cursor, Claude code, and ChatGPT</li>
<li style="""">Security, Observability, and Monitoring tools such as Grafana and Datadog</li>
</ul>
<div class=""h2""><strong>Benefits &amp; Compensation</strong></div>

Principal Site Reliability Engineer,Ashby,Americas,"<p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry site reliability engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h1"">About the role and how we work</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">I’m <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenie-godzaridis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>Elénie</u></a>, a Director of Engineering at Ashby. I’ve been an SRE for a long time, but I didn’t begin there. I started my career building algorithms to process large 3D models for civil engineers and route packets faster for telecommunications (“real infrastructure”). There, I found that what makes or breaks the customer experience is the result of often unseen but critical infrastructure work. This critical work makes the admin UI on the website load fast at the airport, the drafts of your models recoverable if your laptop crashes, the data you dearly value, safe.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">That’s why I switched from working on product to infrastructure: we’ve all seen those outages first reported by a customer because there’s no monitoring, those cute sadface graphics so you’ll be less angry at the software when it inevitably crashes, those late nights your coworkers spend toiling away at failed releases, missing database rows, or misbehaving firewalls. I wanted to create fully-automated solutions to those reliability issues, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_PJQZGMUsM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>use software instead of processes</u></a> to make infrastructure updates, inter-team schema changes, or data access safe. This can work very well: the systems I built reduced yearly downtime to minutes, and some <a href=""https://elenie.ca/kafka-consumer-management-game"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>were even fun</u></a>. I believe training people starts with <a href=""https://elenie.ca/databases-for-developers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>meeting them where they are</u></a>, and infrastructure engineers have empathy as a core skill.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">As an SRE at Ashby, you’ll do that and more. Every Product Engineer owns their projects and ships with minimal oversight. We, as SREs, approach this from a practical view. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Optimize <a href=""https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h1"">Why you should or shouldn’t apply</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">You should apply if:</p><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You never stop</em>. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You don’t take shortcuts.</em> You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with</em>, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at </em>- you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome </em>😉<em>).</em> You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p></li></ul><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You don’t want to make your own decisions </em>on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You hate SQL.</em> We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You don’t want to code.</em> Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings.</em> We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><em>You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates.</em> We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p></li></ul><div class=""h1"">Technology Stack</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h1"">What We’re Building</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h1"">Engineering Culture</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h2"">Collaboration is Natural, Communication is Deliberate</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a href=""https://www.ashbyhq.com/team"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it <a href=""https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>here</u></a>). Even managers can rely on getting consistent time (and support to make, if necessary) to focus and do creative work without the demand of constant meetings.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h2"">Increase Leverage, not Team Size</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. </strong>At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it <a href=""https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>here</u></a>).</p></li></ul><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby: </p><div style=""text-align:left""><img src=""https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png"" style=""max-width:100%""></div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">“Working on a generic framework for Surveys is really paying off! I was able to add the Automation Rules feature to EEOC Forms really quickly because I had some generic components and backend code. Took about 10 minutes and ~50 lines of code to do!”</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h2"">Give Engineers Ownership &amp; Autonomy</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. All of us in technical leadership did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design.

Product Lead,Tern,USA,"<div class=""h2"">ABOUT TERN</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Tern is a venture-backed software company on a mission to reshape the $127B travel agency industry—by giving power back to the entrepreneurs who built it.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Nearly 98% of travel agencies are small businesses. These businesses have been chronically underserved by technology. We’re here to change that. Our platform helps travel advisors run more efficient, professional, and profitable operations—giving them the modern infrastructure they need to lead the next chapter of travel.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">But the impact goes beyond business. Travel advisors help clients move more intentionally through the world. When a traveler works with an advisor, they're more likely to avoid overtouristed hotspots and more likely to spend their dollars in places where they can do real good. That’s the kind of travel we want more of.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">At Tern, we believe in small business. We believe in the power of travel. And we’re building the future of both.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h2"">PRODUCT LEAD</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">As our second Product Lead at Tern, you’ll join a company that strives to be one of the best-operating R&amp;D organizations in the world. We’re looking for someone who thrives on intensity, ownership, and constant growth, and is excited to dive into an early stage, fast growing startup.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">A few things that make Tern a unique place to work:</p><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Product management is “full stack” - from user research, to product development, to QA, to launching features and communicating with users about them. We believe owning the end to end process leads to better results - you hear pain points directly from users, you work with design and engineering to fix them, and then you make sure the updates you ship actually address what you heard.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We’re user obsessed - we live in our advisor Facebook group and feedback community and jump on multiple research calls every week. We lean into negative feedback with curiosity, and seek to rapidly fix the problems we hear. When we don’t have enough user context we feel it in our bones - and fix it immediately.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Every squad at Tern ships features, engineering improvements, and quality-of-life updates <strong>weekly 🤯</strong>. That cadence is really intense - and incredibly rewarding. Projects have to be well scoped into shippable chunks based on the most important user needs. Testing and documentation has to happen immediately to unblock bug fixing and rollouts. Getting this right is difficult - but allows us to add value for our users and learn something new every single week.</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We’re leveling up how we work by integrating AI throughout our product development process - from research and PRD writing, to prototyping, to kicking off PRs for inbound issues ourselves. As a Product Lead, you’ll be expected to lean into these new tools and help us redefine what a next-generation product org looks like.</p></li></ul><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">If you feel energized and excited about working in this way, we want to meet you.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h2"">WHAT YOU’LL DO</div><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Own a product area or squad end-to-end, shipping valuable user-facing work every single week</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Drive product discovery with an obsessive focus on our travel advisors - through user calls, async feedback loops, and using the product yourself</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Write exceptionally clear PRDs, slicing initiatives into focused, shippable parts that deliver value fast without overworking the team</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Operate as the connective tissue between users, engineering, design, and go-to-market — bringing clarity, context, and ruthless prioritization</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Use AI (and help us innovate how we use AI) across research, iteration, planning, and execution</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Ensure tight feedback loops and empower teammates to move fast with autonomy and confidence</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Constantly level up how we work: from process to quality bar to culture of ownership</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Deeply understand and track our product quality - raising the bar proactively, not reactively</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Make sure nothing falls through the cracks - we value people who hold it all in their head and notice what others miss</p></li></ul><div class=""h2"">WHAT YOU HAVE</div><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Clear thinking under pressure; an ability to simplify chaos and get to the root of the problem</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Extreme ownership - you take responsibility for the outcome, not just your part of it</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Obsessive attention to detail; you’re the kind of person who notices the edge case no one else brought up</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Strong product instincts, with a feel for what great looks like (or hunger to get there)</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Excellent communication - crisp writing, contextual thinking, and ability to bring stakeholders along without over-managing</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Comfort with pace - we ship weekly and expect product to lead the prioritization and scoping that makes that sustainable</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">A builder mindset - bias to action, comfort with ambiguity, and hunger to learn and improve rapidly</p></li></ul><div class=""h2"">BONUS POINTS</div><ul style=""""><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Experience in fintech or travel (especially B2B2C platforms or marketplaces)</p></li><li style=""""><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Strong familiarity with AI tools (especially prompting, prototyping, or workflows in product)</p></li></ul><p style=""min-height:1.5em""></p><div class=""h2"">WHAT WE VALUE @ TERN</div><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><strong>🌱 We’re always leveling up.</strong></p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">Whether you’re deepening your craft, learning from a teammate, or embracing a new challenge, growth is core to our identity.</p><p style=""min-height:1.5em""><strong>🧭 We act with optimistic agency</strong></p><p style=""min-height:1.5em"">We take initiative, seek clarity, and move forward, even when the path isn't obvious.

"Senior Engineer (TypeScript, Node.js, React)",Spidergap,Worldwide,"<p>We’re recruiting a Senior Engineer to join our product team at Ukoru.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to join a small, 100% remote, profitable and ambitious company that also appreciates that there’s more to work than revenue (!).</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""h2"">At Ukoru, we’re:</div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Fueled by the passion and exceptional talent of a successful start-up</li>
<li style="""">Hungry to amaze our customers and grow the business</li>
<li style="""">Always looking to grow as individuals and a team</li>
<li style="""">AND Focused on doing it all without unnecessary stress, and with a healthy work-life balance</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’re a software developer who moves quickly and values code quality, wants to grow by working in a small and experienced team, and loves helping real customers to achieve their goals… then read on!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></em><em> Ukoru's our latest product and is only just starting to be tested with customers, so we don't have much of a web presence yet. If you’d like to read reviews from our customers and employees, search for our other products: Spidergap and AirManual.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""h2"">What we do</div>
<p>We’re the team behind Spidergap and AirManual — both top-rated B2B SaaS products. We’re now working on Ukoru — an ambitious new platform with the mission to transform how businesses manage people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ukoru</strong></p>
<p>At Ukoru, we’re developing a platform to support:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Employees getting feedback and growing as individuals</li>
<li style="""">Teams creating processes that deliver results with minimal stress</li>
<li style="""">Businesses scaling this up whether they have 10 people or 10,000+</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Right now, we’re prototyping and rapidly iterating on designs with the help of hundreds of our existing customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an engineering team, we’re working in a greenfield environment — using the latest and greatest technologies (e.g. NestJS, Tanstack Start, Tiptap, Hocuspocus, OpenAI) and unhindered by legacy constraints. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Spidergap</strong></p>
<p>Spidergap is a 360° Feedback platform — a tool that lets you collect feedback about an employee from their peers, managers, and direct reports.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve been the <a href=""https://www.capterra.com/360-degree-feedback-software/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>top-rated 360° Feedback tool since 2017</strong></a>, which we’ve achieved by:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Designing a revolutionary feedback report, that makes it really easy for employees to review and understand the feedback they receive</li>
<li style="""">Creating a platform that’s super-customizable to the needs of different organizations</li>
<li style="""">Providing world-class support that customers rave about</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re used in 134+ countries and by thousands of organizations including Samsung, 3M, Sony, the NHS, the European Commission, Breville, Konica Minolta and Philips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AirManual</strong></p>
<p>We created AirManual in 2020 with the goal of helping other businesses to scale up, without constant stress. We provide tools for documenting and automating processes, working together in teams, and reviewing the health of the entire business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re supporting over 100 businesses, including big names such as Asahi Beer and with particular traction in the Accountancy market. As with Spidergap, we consistently get <a href=""https://www.capterra.com/p/235723/AirManual/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>exceptionally positive reviews</strong></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We expect to incorporate and build on AirManual’s features and benefits in Ukoru.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br><br></p>
<p>We’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for our company values, and who can bring the technical talent needed in this specific role.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you share our values?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking for people who share our values:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="""">
<li style=""""><strong>Focus on impact: </strong>We know our growth is dependent on increasing the value we deliver to customers. We focus our energy on improvements that will make a real difference, with a desired outcome made clear up-front. We expect everyone to understand <em>why</em> they are working on a particular activity or objective, being clear on how it will benefit the business and our customers.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Be proactive and dependable: </strong>Everyone can solve problems and remove barriers to growth — both personally and for the company. We are quick to raise issues and ideas, and to recommend next steps. We make it easier for others to feel they can depend on us by being proactive in our communication and action.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Pay attention to detail: </strong>We believe the quality of everything we do is a competitive advantage. We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude. </li>
<li style=""""><strong>Always look to improve:</strong> We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Enjoy the journey: </strong>We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal — we delight in each step along the way.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>We don’t just ‘say’ these are our values. We use them all the time — to recruit the right people, manage individual performance, recognize good practice, and make decisions. </p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""h2"">Is the role right for you?</div>
<p>A large part of the work will be developing and supporting new functionality using TypeScript, NodeJS, React and Postgres.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We follow “clean"" code principles, agile processes and continuous integration tools to efficiently take features from concept to roll-out, and to continuously optimize our processes. Your attention to detail will help us to amaze our customers, and to grow our services and codebase in a robust and maintainable way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Collaborate to deliver solutions from design to release</li>
<li style="""">Write reliable, modular, well-tested and “clean” code</li>
<li style="""">Proactively raise ideas and issues, contributing to designs with feedback and suggestions for improvement</li>
<li style="""">Support other team members through peer review</li>
<li style="""">Help to optimize our development processes and build tools</li>
<li style="""">Ensure progress, issues and ideas are communicated clearly to the right people</li>
<li style="""">Help us to deliver outstanding customer support.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tech stack (Ukoru)</strong></p>
<p>We expect the majority of your time to be spent working on Ukoru, which uses:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">TypeScript</li>
<li style="""">React (Tanstack Start)</li>
<li style="""">Node.js (NestJS)</li>
<li style="""">Hocuspocus/yjs for real time collaboration</li>
<li style="""">Postgres</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>From time-to-time, you may also need to support our existing Spidergap and AirManual apps — we look to spread knowledge and expertise across the team, so no-one has to work when they’re on holiday or sick! These platforms include legacy solutions developed with Express, Create React App, AngularJS, Loopback, PHP and MySQL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Google Cloud</li>

<li style="""">Hubspot</li>
<li style="""">(And many more!)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>

<li style="""">Excellent attention to detail, including a focus on delivering high-quality code that is easy to maintain and scale</li>

<li style="""">Believes in and practices self-improvement / personal development</li>
<li style="""">Loves technology and figuring out how things work and helping others to do the same</li>
<li style="""">Communicates clearly, in a friendly way</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">This is a 100% remote job — you are responsible for having an effective work environment</li>
<li style="""">You must be in a location that overlaps the working hours of our existing team members — we will only accept applications in timezones from UTC -5 (New York) to UTC +6 (Dhaka)</li>
<li style="""">Due to local employment and/or international laws, we cannot currently employ people based in Brazil, France, Russia, or UAE.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

When electricity arrived, it didn’t just light up homes—it transformed industries, democratized wealth, and empowered everyone, from factory owners to farmers, to grow and thrive. Today, with AI, we have the opportunity to do the same for the real economy.""</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">""For the last two decades, the tech industry has had an incredible advantage. Computers have been like co-pilots for us, quietly amplifying our productivity and enabling us to grow faster than ever before. But 95% of businesses—builders, plumbers, and real estate agents—have been technically starved. These businesses make up 50% of GDP, five times larger than the entire tech industry, but they’ve never had access to the tools they need to compete.""</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">""This is the inequality we’re solving. APE AI is democratizing technology, bringing the power of compute to businesses that have been left behind. And what’s so rewarding is that we’re not just helping faceless corporations—we’re empowering real people. Small business owners who pour their hearts into their work. People whose success directly impacts their families, their communities, and society at large. It’s deeply rewarding to see firsthand the transformation in small businesses as they embrace their agent—not just as a tool, but as a trusted, hard-working member of their team.""</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">""For me, this mission is personal. I’ve spent my career building companies that encourage people to connect in real life, to be physically active, and to engage with their communities. This isn’t just about productivity—it’s about health, happiness, and thriving societies. Humans weren’t built to spend their lives staring at screens. We’re wired to interact, to move, to be part of the real world. And what excites me is that Ape AI is helping to make this possible—empowering businesses that create real-world value to thrive at the same pace as the tech giants.""</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">""This isn’t just about technology. It’s about fairness. It’s about giving the power of compute to the people who need it most, so they can grow, thrive, and make a difference. That’s our mission, and it’s something we can all be proud of.</p>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">In this decade, the world will create artificial intelligence that reaches human level intelligence (and beyond) by combining learning and search. There will only be a small number of companies who will achieve this. Their ability to stack advantages and pull ahead will determine who survives and wins. These companies will move faster than anyone else. They will attract the world's most capable talent. They will be on the forefront of applied research and engineering at scale. They will create powerful economic engines. They will continue to scale their training to larger &amp; more capable models. They will be given the right to raise large amounts of capital along their journey to enable this.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">poolside exists to be one of these companies - to build a world where AI will drive the majority of economically valuable work and scientific progress.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We believe that software development will be the first major capability in neural networks that reaches human-level intelligence because it's the domain where we can combine Search and Learning approaches the best.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">At poolside we believe our applied research needs to culminate in products that are put in the hands of people. Today we focus on building for a developer-led increasingly AI-assisted world. We believe that current capabilities of AI lead to incredible tooling that can assist developers in their day to day work. We also believe that as we increase the capabilities of our models, we increasingly empower anyone in the world to be able to build software. We envision a future where not 100 million people can build software but 2 billion people can.</p>

<p><strong>Learn about TRM Speed in this position:</strong></p>
<ul style="""">
<li class='""li1""' style=""""><strong>Ruthless Prioritization &amp; Adaptability</strong>: We adapt quickly when faced with new information.

Instead we focus on ruthless prioritization and pivot quickly as needed.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Challenging Timelines (Execution Pressure): </strong>An engineer questions a teammate’s proposed 3-week timeline, and constructively argues for condensing it to 2 weeks—backed by rationale, tradeoffs, and a plan to reduce scope or increase velocity.

<li style=""""><strong>Time-Boxed Spiking (Rapid Learning &amp; Decision-Making): </strong>An engineer proposes a 1-week spike with a clear time-box and success criteria to explore implementation options or validate feasibility through a proof of concept.

Lead Systems Administrator,Zocdoc,USA,"<div class='""content-intro""'>
<p><strong>Our Mission<br></strong></p>
<p>Healthcare should work for patients, but it doesn’t. In their time of need, they call down outdated insurance directories. Then wait on hold. Then wait weeks for the privilege of a visit. Then wait in a room solely designed for waiting. Then wait for a surprise bill. In any other consumer industry, the companies delivering such a poor customer experience would not survive. But in healthcare, patients lack market power. Which means they are expected to accept the unacceptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Zocdoc’s mission is to give power to the patient. To do that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across +200 specialties and +12k insurance plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down. </p>
